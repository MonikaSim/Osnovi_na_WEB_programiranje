                 <h2>Milan</h2>
                 <p> Milan, a metropolis in Italy's northern Lombardy region,
                  is a global capital of fashion and design. Home to the national
                  stock exchange, it’s a financial hub also known for its high-end 
                 restaurants and shops. The Gothic Duomo di Milano cathedral and the
                  Santa Maria delle Grazie convent, housing Leonardo da Vinci’s mural 
                 “The Last Supper,” testify to centuries of art and culture.
                 The city has been recognized as one of the world's four fashion capitals
                  thanks to several international events and fairs, including Milan Fashion 
                  Week and the Milan Furniture Fair, which are currently among the world's 
                  biggest in terms of revenue, visitors and growth.It hosted the
                   Universal Exposition in 1906 and 2015. The city hosts numerous cultural institutions, 
                   academies and universities, with 11% of the national total of enrolled students.
                    Milan received 10 million visitors in 2018, with the largest numbers of foreign 
                    visitors coming from China, United States, France and Germany.The tourists are attracted by Milan's 
                    museums and art galleries that include some of the most important collections in the 
                    world, including major works by Leonardo da Vinci.

                <h2>Split</h2>
                <p> Split is the second largest city of Croatia and the largest city in the region of Dalmatia. 
                  It lies on the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea and is spread over a central peninsula 
                  and its surroundings.The city was founded as the Greek colony of Aspálathos in the
                   3rd or 2nd century BC on the coast of the Illyrian Dalmatae, and later on was home to Diocletian's 
                   Palace, built for the Roman emperor in AD 305. It became a prominent settlement around 650 when it 
                   succeeded the ancient capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia, Salona. After the sack of Salona by
                    the Avars and Slavs, the fortified Palace of Diocletian was settled by Roman refugees. Split became
                     a Byzantine city. Later it drifted into the sphere of the Republic of Venice and the Kingdom of Croatia,
                      with the Byzantines retaining nominal suzerainty. For much of the High and Late Middle Ages, Split enjoyed
                       autonomy as a free city of the Dalmatian city-states, 
                  caught in the middle of a struggle between Venice and Croatia for control over the Dalmatian cities.
                  There is no other Split. What is even London compared to Split. Who can pay for this beauty?
                  Those are just a few of countless saying used to make a simple case: Split is the most beautiful
                   place in the world. Of course, there is no most beautiful 
                  place in the world, but people in Split genuinely and sincerely believe in that. So, don't oppose that view.

                    <h2>Venice</h2>
                    <p> Venice, the capital of northern Italy’s Veneto region,
                       is built on more than 100 small islands in a lagoon in 
                       the Adriatic Sea. It has no roads, just canals – including
                        the Grand Canal thoroughfare – lined with Renaissance and 
                        Gothic palaces. The central square, Piazza San Marco, contains
                         St. Mark’s Basilica, which is tiled with Byzantine mosaics, 
                         and the Campanile bell tower offering views of the city’s red roofs.
                         Venice is one of the most popular Italian cities for tourists, 
                         even with all the other beautiful & historic places there are in Italy.
                     But there’s a good reason. The City of Water is celebrated because of
                      its unusual circumstances, sitting on 100+ small islands connected by over 400 bridges.
                    There are basically no roads, transportation is accomplished via boats on a 
                    confusing network of canals. It’s truly unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before 
                        There are many quirky, unique, unusual, and secret spots to discover in Venice.

                <h2>Budapest</h2>
                <p> Budapest, Hungary’s capital, is bisected by the River Danube.
                    Its 19th-century Chain Bridge connects the hilly Buda district
                    with flat Pest. A funicular runs up Castle Hill to Buda’s Old Town,
                     where the Budapest History Museum traces city life from Roman times onward. 
                     Trinity Square is home to 13th-century Matthias 
                  Church and the turrets of the Fishermen’s Bastion, which offer sweeping views.
                  The history of Budapest began when an early Celtic settlement transformed into 
                  the Roman town of Aquincum,the capital of Lower Pannonia.The Hungarians arrived 
                  in the territory in the late 9th century, but the area was pillaged by the Mongols
                   in 1241–42.Re-established Buda became one of the centres of Renaissance humanist 
                   culture by the 15th century.The Battle of Mohács, in 1526, was followed 
                   by nearly 150 years of Ottoman rule.After the reconquest of Buda in 1686,
                    the region entered a new age of prosperity, with Pest-Buda becoming a global
                     city after the unification of Buda, Óbuda and Pest on 17 November 1873, with 
                     the name 'Budapest' given to the new capital.Budapest also became the co-capital
                      of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,a great power that dissolved in 1918, following
                       World War I. The city was the focal point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, 
                       the Battle of Budapest in 1945, as well as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.
